# KSIG

$2 trillion of crypto assets are held in single key accounts. KSIG is an offline PWA and signing solution allowing anyone to benefit from Hedera’s highly secure, native multi-sig. KSIG eliminates “single point of failure” by decentralising risk, and opens the door to mass-market usability at all levels, from social account recovery to institutional asset management.

KSIG works entirely offline, including:
- Seed creation
- Cold storage (e.g., NFC)
- Air-gapped offline signing
- QR receipt/transmission of transactions and signatures

KSIG integrates with other ecosystem tools to provide a modular solution that’s ready to grow.  
Finally, DLT with decentralised key management that’s accessible to all.
